# Visualizing Covid-19
Data science projects to visualize coronavirus data. I aim to use data generated from the New York Times' data [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) 
to create a queriable API using Flask. After that, a web interface for the data will be created for easy user
navigation, with data visualizations being provided alongside.

## TODO
   - start working on the crossfilter choropleth
   - fix the color scaling for the basic choropleth map
